      "entry": "I was so amazed by the demos this morning; it is absolutely amazing how creative everyone’s projects were and how much effort and hard work everyone put into them. I do not know enough right now to understand all the technologies they used, but it is very inspiring. I am humbled, nervous, and just a plethora of emotions. I hope to be able to do something even a little bit close to what I have seen. We all took the 16Personalities quiz; I was not surprised about the result, but I was surprised at just how accurate it was as I continued to read further. We were split into our “results group” and asked to discuss what the most effective and most ineffective way of communicating was for our group. I think the consensus was we all really disliked aggressive styles. For homework, I tried working on the CSS Selectors practice… after hours of trying everything to use CSS parent-child relationships to reach the nested elements, I realized I mistyped my closing </h4> tag in HTML. This whole experience enlightened me about how we should be troubleshooting our issues and having fresh eyes look at our code really does help  (thank you to the lovely classmates in the zoom room)!"

Learned to open Network CTRL-SHIFT-J and make sure to click “Disable Cache” in order to see the latest changes you have made to the webpage. Learned about semantic HTML components and CSS selector usage; integrated VSCode into our workflow and used serve -n to serve the webpage.We met out Big Sibs today; she is so down-to-earth and gave really great advice. I am sure she will be a great resource in the future. Started working on flexbox concepts with Flexbox Froggy; finished HTML Practice exercise. Reflecting on the past few days, I am grateful for the classmates who are so giving and willing to help. I think part of my nervousness stems from not having very much previous experience in this field- that’s why we’re here!. I feel like I do not have to be embarrassed about asking what I think may be stupid questions or if I don’t understand something… the learning style is very different from grad/professional school where there was not very much room to make mistakes or fail."

Embarrassed that I could not get pictures saved into my Linux folder (one classmate had a really good idea about creating a shortcut from my Linux folder to my Desktop); Realized how powerful flexbox can be and how much simpler it is to use that to create organization and structure on your webpage. Finished Flexbox Froggy and started working on Flexbox practice. Committed my initial versions of HTML Practice, CSS Selectors. Learned about .gitignore- once added will not track any unnecessary files, therefore will not be uploaded to GH. README.md explains what your project is about; how to run your code."

We created pull requests for them to be reviewed; took turns approving each other’s pull requests after viewing their code. After any changes were made we “pulled” it to review it once more and if everything was good to go, we allowed the merge of their branch to the master. I embarrassingly realized I submitted my commits for my practice problems onto cohort41’s page rather than my own, but thanks to Audrey we got on the right track again! Finished UI/UX  Challenge for HTML Practice and created new branch sf-styling? in GitHub to update it. Started updating my LinkedIn page after four or more years of inactivity… To reset or change the URL for a remote git repository: git remote set-url origin URL from GH (SSH key not HTTP) after you create a new repository. git remote -v  will display URLs of your remote repositories connected to your local computer’s repository."
